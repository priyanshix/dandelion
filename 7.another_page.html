<h1>Dandelion</h1>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a dandelion flower nestled in a yard. It was a neglected yard, and many dandelions grew in it.</p>
<p>While many dandelion flowers in this yard were either pulled out or trampled on, this particular dandelion grew and flourished. It enjoyed its time in the yard. It was a comfortable place with enough sunlight and water, and it was kept nicely hidden behind blades of tall, green grass.</p>
<p>However, after some time, the dandelion’s petals were no longer the lively yellow color it had once been. The dandelion’s seeds had matured, and as a result, the vibrant little flower had morphed into a sphere of soft white.</p>
<p>This is when the seeds began talking to each other.</p>
<p>One seed told the other, “I cannot wait to fly out of here, I’ve been here long enough. I’m tired of the same old yard.”</p>
